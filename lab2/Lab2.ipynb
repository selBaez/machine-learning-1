    "* The lab exercises should be made in groups of two people.\n",
    "* The deadline is October 9th (Sunday) 23:59.\n",
    "* Assignment should be sent to your teaching assistant. The subject line of your email should be \"lab\\#\\_lastname1\\_lastname2\\_lastname3\".\n",
    "* Put your and your teammates' names in the body of the email.\n",
    "* Attach the .IPYNB (IPython Notebook) file containing your code and answers. Naming of the file follows the same rule as the subject line. For example, if the subject line is \"lab01\\_Kingma\\_Hu\", the attached file should be \"lab01\\_Kingma\\_Hu.ipynb\". Only use underscores (\"\\_\") to connect names, otherwise the files cannot be parsed.\n",

    "* For this notebook you need to answer a few theory questions, add them in the Markdown cell's below the question. Note: you can use Latex-style code in here.\n",
    "* Focus on Part 1 the first week, and Part 2 the second week!\n",
    "* You should write your code and answers below the questions in this IPython Notebook.\n",
    "* Among the first lines of your notebook should be \"%pylab inline\". This imports all required modules, and your plots will appear inline.\n",
    "* If you have questions outside of the labs, post them on blackboard or email me.\n",

    "You derived equations for finding the _maximum likelihood_ solution of the parameters. Explain, in a few sentences, how you could extend this approach so that it optimizes towards a _maximum a posteriori_ (MAP) solution of the parameters, with a Gaussian prior on the parameters. \n",

    "\n",
    "You receive an additional 10 bonus points if you manage to train a model with very high accuracy: at most 2.5% misclasified digits on the test set. Note that the test set contains 10000 digits, so you model should misclassify at most 250 digits. This should be achievable with a MLP model with one hidden layer. See results of various models at : `http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html`. To reach such a low accuracy, you probably need to have a very high $L$ (many hidden units), probably $L > 200$, and apply a strong Gaussian prior on the weights. In this case you are allowed to use the validation set for training.\n",
    "You are allowed to add additional layers, and use convolutional networks, although that is probably not required to reach 2.5% misclassifications."
