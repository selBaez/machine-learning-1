This, in turn, requires the derivative of the kernel matrix $\\CN$ wrt $\\thetav$.  This is the matrix of element-wise derivatives of the kernel function.

You may want to play around with $\\thetav$ and see what each parameter does/affects/etc.  (5 points)  Describe why the best parameters work well for the training data and explain why the bad parameter settings perform poorly (in terms of the first part of the question).
